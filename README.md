# About this Triple Bass Ocarina ICO Tab Composer
Using this small utility, you should be able to intuitively write and export as PNGs your music sheets.

## Current version - Ver. 1.0 (BETA).

### What is the tool about:
- This tool uses typing canvas as a field for creating a sheet music, buttons representing both each note's depiction, name and fingering patterns I developed myself for a smoother readability on smaller scales/screens. This enables flexible operating for musicians with any background.
- Simply by clicking on one or another button, the corresponding fingering pattern with be added to the current cursor position. Additionally, you are able to use keyboard for typing (useful, when you need to add some additional notes like "(", ")", "â€”" or "x2").
- As a small nice-to-have the utility automatically creates a gray vertical line for each occupied sheet's row to give a player a hint when does the page end (may be useful when you play, reading from the sheet).
- By pressing the "Export as PNG" button you'll be able to save your current state of the canvas as a PNG file.

### What is currently planned:
- Add breakpoints for smaller screens to maintain app's responsiveness;
- Implement an option to add additional pages and multi-export as a PDF;
- Add notes' sounds to buttons' hover state to enable a full focus on creation.
